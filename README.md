# Hello 👋

I'm MrBoombastic - T H E&nbsp;&nbsp;G R E A T&nbsp;&nbsp;D E V E L O P E R

People say I'm funny, intelligent and sensible, but I'm not. I make every decision by starting a new thread on
StackOverflow or similar sites. You can contact me by clicking on my website under my profile

# My Interests:

- 😿 JavaScript/Node.JS
- 💖 Go
- ☁️ Cloud in general - managing VPSes, networks, policies. Azure and GCP are cool.
- 🍉 RaspberryPI
- 🤔 Linux based systems. I treat them more as a curiosity than a daily driver. At least on the desktop.
- 💾 Computers on the hardware side. Processors, graphics cards, and releases that only happen on paper.
- 🥚 Shortwave radio
- 🎹 Music - especially from the 70s to the 90s. I like everything from classic electronic music by Jean-Michel Jarre and
  Kraftwerk, by early techno music, to Depeche Mode and Pink Floyd. Today's music is mostly crap
  to me.

# My projects:

- 📻 FmRadioStreamer - an app for broadcasting your own songs on the air, based on existing libraries.
- 🔥 HEAT - an app to quickly set up Hurricane Electric tunnels.
- 🕵️ OSINTCord - retrieves data from almost all members of Discord servers.
- 🕸️ GrOxyP - a microservice to check if an IP belongs to a VPN or proxy pool.
- 👻 GhostBackupper - easily backup your Ghost CMS instance.

# Currently working on:

- [BOOMfinity](https://boomfinity.xyz) - funny Discord bot with some nice add-ons
- [NaProdukcji](https://naprodukcji.xyz) - my blog about technology and security
- [ZaufanaTrzeciaStrona](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/) - 'only' tools research and development

# Quick Q&A, only that the answers themselves:

- I've stolen my nickname from a Shaggy song.
- And yes, I've stolen my avatar from my own bot too.
- \***** ***
- JavaScript sucks sometimes, but it's like masochism - I can happily live with it. Well, except maybe for the lack of
  multithreading.
- PHP should die along with Flash and Silverlight.
- I wish I could write beautiful frontend. I mean, I can, but only ugly. I'm a bad UX designer.

# Image fillers, so you can have finally something to look at:

- Public repositories only:

- My biggest project - BOOMfinity (you can click on it 😮):

- I've run out of ideas for pictures.

# My list of hated things:

- PHP
- n00bz who poison my life forever with the same questions they ask on DMs.
- TikTok
- Fortnite
- Google's policy of culling a random app every 3 months on average.
- Apple - it just doesn't work
- Polish variable names in code.
- [Unx'](https://github.com/unxcepted) code. It's hopeless and always needs to be rewritten from scratch.

That's about it. If I remember anything, I'll add it. 😄
